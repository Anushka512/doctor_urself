        data: "I was treated by Mrs. Deepta Manohar for Hypertension and lifestyle changeover between 2020-2021. I was diagnosed of Hypertension during November 2019 with some symptoms of Nausea, Tiredness, Giddiness, etc ., Considering my family history of Hypertension and Diabetes, the first reaction to this diagnosis was anxiety and panic. The first treatment I got was by an allopathy doctor who first tried to help me reduce my weight and switch over to a healthy lifestyle with no medicines. While I rigorously started working towards losing weight and change to a better lifestyle, I still was consumed by anxiety and fear. The reasons for anxiety & fear were due to years of living with parents who had these issues and the ill effects it had on them which was bothering me mentally that I too would end up having such issues. During my weekly checkups, my BP reading constantly showed a reading of 140/90+ basis which the allopathy doctor decided to put me on medication as she understood that the only way to get my anxiety down was by putting me on BP medicines which would help control the numbers and my anxiety. For three months, it did have a positive effect as the readings were under control and psychologically, I started feeling that my life is not under threat without understanding that continuous use of medicines would have a long-term side effect. That is when I was directed to Mrs. Deepta Manohar, a traditional acupuncture therapist. The reference was given by my friend who was taking treatment from Deepta for quite sometime and gave very positive feedback about her treatment and the change in health conditions. I reached out to Mrs. Deepta Manohar during Feb-March 2020 and the first thing she did was to know me better by talking to me and understanding my anxiety issues more than the actual hypertension issue. Once she understood that my condition was more to do with my living habits and anxiety, she started treating me more for my anxiety and better lifestyle. At the begging of the treatment, like any other human I was not very convinced if things would work for better considering she asked me to stop the Hypertension medication with immediate effect and my anxiety levels elevated even more with the fear of it going out of control. Gradually with weekly treatment, Deepta gave me a lot of positive directions towards how our mind plays a major part in maintaining the overall health. I started reading more about body’s natural healing process and methods, started mediation, yoga and breathing techniques in addition to following the diet March 020toDec 2020, I started noticing big change in both my psychological and physical health. I started believing that my body has the power to heal by itself and that belief did take me back to my normal health. I stopped checking my BP constantly and whenever I did, I noticed that my readings had come back to normal. Even today, I follow the guidance of Mrs. Deepta Manohar whenever I face any symptoms. I lost close to 10 kilos and I have been successful in maintaining that till now with a healthy diet, yoga and breathing exercises. In 2020, with the onset of COVID in India, I did get infected once in June but I noticed that I could heal myself without any medication within a matter of one week. That went to prove that my immunity had improved a lot and both my body and psychological state. I used to get a lot of headaches too for which I used to either take pain killers or coffee as an alternative but post my treatment from Deepta, the headache frequency has reduced quite a lot and even when it does hit me, I follow Deepta’s advice on how to get it naturally cured. Overall, I would like to say that my decision to reach out to Mrs. Deepta Manohar basis the recommendation of my friend was the best thing. She helped revive the old beliefs, methods and lifestyle that has certainly helped me balance my psychological and physical health. So, I take this opportunity to thank Mrs. Deepta Manohar for her selfless help and for sharing her precious gift with humanity. Life as we know has become a rat race and all of us have forgotten our forefather’s way of lifestyle. We are constantly looking for faster treatments and way out so we can be part of the rat race, but my experience in getting treated by Mrs. Deepta Manohar was like a rebirth and back to the stone age where medical science was all natural and no chemicals. Unfortunately, from childhood, our parents have always rushed us to a nearby doctor to get us treated during ill health situation and that in turn becomes a habit. To change from what we are to what we were decades ago requires belief and guidance, which I found in this treatment. I strongly recommend to all those who are still contemplating if this is the right path for getting healed, to start believing and making the right move. If I could see a positive change then why cant others.",

I had spent almost 10,000 on various allopathic treatments but have worked none worked  they find out the root cause. I once saw my sister-in-law reduce weight and when I enquired about it she introduced me to a traditional alcomputerist, Deepta Manohar. I started taking the treatment and it worked wonders for me. I could see visible changes in just a months time . During the first month itself all my pimples , marks and blemishes started healing . It just felt like magic after all jailed attempts done earlier. It was completely healed within 3 months, My skin also had a glow to it. Adding to this & also lost weight which my medical checks always reported to as overweight. Yes, of was overweight too ( not obese, but fat ). This was due to the stress That I had taken doing my college work required we to go sleepless most of the times and short deadlines in completing my drawing charts. This treatment helped me loose unhealthy weight too . It not only made me physically fit out also mentally stable. I learnt to control my stress, I learnt to control my emotions. It helped me understand how to eat healthy and what the body actually needs.
